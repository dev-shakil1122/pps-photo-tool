# NLGenerator - Intelligent Document Suite

**NLGenerator** is a premium, design-first suite of web tools designed to streamline the creation of essential business and personal documents. From CVs to Quotations and Invoices, our goal is to minimize time-to-value while delivering aesthetically stunning results.

> **For Agents & Developers**: This document serves as the "Source of Truth" for the brand vision, architectural patterns, and design system. Read this before adding new tools.

## 🌟 Brand Vision & Design Philosophy

Our users shouldn't just "complete a task"—they should be **delighted** by the experience.

### 1. Aesthetic Excellence (The "Wow" Factor)
- **Visuals**: We refuse to be generic. We use **Glassmorphism**, subtle shadows, and vibrant but professional colors.
- **Typography**: We strictly use **'Inter'** from Google Fonts for a clean, modern, and readable look.
- **Interactions**: Interfaces must feel alive. Use hover effects (lift + shadow), smooth transitions (`0.3s`), and interactive feedback.
- **Premium Feel**: Avoid "bootstrap-default" looks. Every card, button, and input should feel custom and polished.

### 2. Time-Saving Workflow
- **Pre-built Templates**: Users should not need to design. They select a premium template.
- **Input -> Output**: The core flow is separated:
  1.  **Input**: A clean, structured form to capture data.
  2.  **Generation**: Immediate rendering of the document based on the chosen template.

## 📂 Project Architecture

The project follows a modular, flat structure for easy extensibility.

```
/NLGenerator
├── index.html            # Main Dashboard / Landing Page
├── assets/               # Shared logic, preview images, global styles
└── tools/                # Individual Tool Modules
    ├── cv/               # CV Generator
    ├── quotation/        # Quotation Tool
    ├── invoice/          # Invoice Generator
    └── [new-tool]/       # Your new tool goes here
```

### Tool Structure Pattern
Each tool inside `tools/` should typically follow this pattern:

- **`index.html`** or **`input.html`**: The entry point. Contains the user input form.
- **`templates.html`** or **`view.html`**: The output view or template selection screen.
- **`templates/`**: (Optional) Directory for specific template HTML logic if complex.

## 🤖 Guide for Agents: How to Build New Tools

When asked to "add a new tool" (e.g., "Make a Receipt Generator"), follow this strict checklist:

### 1. Design Tokens (CSS Variables)
Use these variables (defined in `index.html` or shared CSS) to maintain consistency:

```css
:root {
    --primary: #2563eb;       /* Brand Blue */
    --bg-body: #f8fafc;       /* Light Gray Background */
    --card-bg: #ffffff;       /* Pure White Cards */
    --text-main: #1e293b;     /* Slate 800 */
    --text-muted: #64748b;    /* Slate 500 */
    --shadow-sm: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### 2. Implementation Steps
1.  **Create Directory**: `tools/receipt-generator/`
2.  **Create Input Form**: `input.html`. Use `card` classes for the form container.
    - *Style*: Use `input[type="text"]` with subtle borders (`#e2e8f0`) and focus rings (`var(--primary)`).
3.  **Create Output/Template**: `view.html`. This is where the magic happens.
    - Ensure it is A4 compatible if meant for print (`@media print`).
4.  **Register Tool**: Add a new Card to the Grid in the root `index.html`.
    - **Icon**: Use FontAwesome (`<i class="fas fa-receipt"></i>`).
    - **Description**: Short, benefits-focused copy.

### 3. "Premium" Checklist
Before finishing a task, ask yourself:
- [ ] Does this look like a 2025 web app, or a 2010 HTML site?
- [ ] Are there hover effects?
- [ ] Is the spacing generous (whitespace is luxury)?
- [ ] Did I use the `Inter` font?

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

- [ ] **Data Persistence**: LocalStorage saving for drafts.
- [ ] **PDF Export**: One-click PDF generation (html2pdf or native print).
- [ ] **More Tools**: Receipt Maker, Cover Letter Builder, Business Card Designer.
